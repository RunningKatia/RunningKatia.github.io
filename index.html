        <p>Over the past few years as an undergraduate student, I've worked in various areas of media and social science, including Non-fiction Writing & Virtual Ethnography, Graphic Design & Digital Marketing, as well as Computational Communication Studies. These days,  I still focus on learning, reading, thinking, and practicing in various fields, in order to strive to expand my knowledge boundaries.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Discovering new knowledge, learning new knowledge, and mastering new knowledge.
            <p>After entering university, I was once confused by the feeling of not knowing where to fit in life. Eventually, I chose to face all the challenges through self-learning. From interviewing, writing, to investigating, researching, and then to planning and operating, I have the ability to accept and challenge each task. The accumulation and acquisition of knowledge and skills are not only quantitative changes but also qualitative changes. Whenever I master a new method, the puzzle of the world becomes more complete before my eyes. Rich experiences have given me a broader mindset, trying different paths taken by others, and seeing unprecedented scenery.</p>
